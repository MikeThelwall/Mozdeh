# Mozdeh
This repository contains three versions of the Windows software Mozdeh for social media downloading (YouTube comments and Reddit posts) and analysis (sentiment, gender, Word Association Thematic Analysis).
Left click on the above links then click on the download button on the right hand side of the new pages to download the files (you can't download them directly from this page).

To run Mozdeh, download one of the three versions to a Windows computer and double-click on it to start it.
The compulsory anonymisation version automatically anonymises usernames and is intended for educational use and sensitive research topics or other contexts where ethical considerations requires user anonymisation.
The Bluesky variant is experimental, including Bluesky query support, and you might need to install .NET 8.0 to get it to work https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

The above list also contains a zipfile of gender and sentiment files and default vocabulary (SentimentAndGender_subfolders_of_moz_data.zip). After starting Mozdeh for the first time, it will create a subfolder called moz_data. Unzip the zipfile into this folder so that the three folders in the zipfile are unzipped inside of moz_data
The main website is available here http://mozdeh.wlv.ac.uk/ or here https://mi-linux.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/mozdeh/ but contains older versions of Mozdeh.

There is no user manual but the above website serves as a manual and you can download and unzip MozdehWebSite.zip on your computer and navigate a local copy of the website from the index.html file.

If you get the error message, "This app can't run on your PC", make sure you have downloaded the program (>2Mb) not the information page (<1Mb).
