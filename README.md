# Mozdeh
This repository contains two versions of the Windows software Mozdeh for social media downloading (YouTube comments and Reddit posts) and analysis (sentiment, gender, Word Association Thematic Analysis).

To run Mozdeh, download one of the two versions to a Windows computer and double-click on it to start it.
The compulsory anonymisation version automatically anonymises usernames and is intended for educational use and sensitive research topics or other contexts where ethical considerations requires user anonymisation.

It also contains a zipfile of gender and sentiment files. After starting Mozdeh for the first time, it will create a subfolder called moz_data. Unzip the zipfile into this folder so that the two folders in the zipfile are unzipped inside of moz_data
The main website http://mozdeh.wlv.ac.uk is (hopefully) temporarily down.

There is no user manual but until the website http://mozdeh.wlv.ac.uk is back up again you could download and unzip MozdehWebSite.zip on your computer and navigate a local copy of the website from the index.html file.
