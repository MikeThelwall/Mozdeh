# Mozdeh
This repository contains two versions of the Windows software Mozdeh for social media downloading (YouTube comments and Reddit posts) and analysis (sentiment, gender, Word Association Thematic Analysis).

To run Mozdeh, download one of the two versions to a Windows computer and double-click on it to start it.
The compulsory anonymisation version automatically anonymises usernames and is intended for educational use and sensitive research topics or other contexts where ethical considerations requires user anonymisation.

The above list also contains a zipfile of gender and sentiment files and default vocabulary (SentimentAndGender_subfolders_of_moz_data.zip). After starting Mozdeh for the first time, it will create a subfolder called moz_data. Unzip the zipfile into this folder so that the three folders in the zipfile are unzipped inside of moz_data
The main website is available here https://mi-linux.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/mozdeh/

There is no user manual but https://mi-linux.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/mozdeh/ serves as a manual and you can download and unzip MozdehWebSite.zip on your computer and navigate a local copy of the website from the index.html file.
